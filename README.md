## ⚙️ How Android Works

Android is built on a layered architecture that includes:

1. **Linux Kernel**  
   The foundation providing core system services like security, memory management, process management, and hardware drivers.

2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**  
   Interfaces between the hardware components and higher-level system services.

3. **Android Runtime (ART)**  
   Each Android app runs in its own process, with its own instance of ART (or previously Dalvik virtual machine).

4. **Native C/C++ Libraries**  
   Provide core features such as graphics rendering, database support, and web rendering.

5. **Application Framework**  
   Provides higher-level services (e.g., activity manager, resource manager, notification manager) that developers use to build apps.

6. **Applications**  
   The top layer; all the user-facing apps you install and use (e.g., phone, messages, camera, third-party apps).
